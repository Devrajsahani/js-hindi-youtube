<!-- get element by id give the whole syntax instead of giving the output 
 
next is get attribute, and it tell what is the working or what is the name of the class, id or whatever is there in the html code like if we put .getattribute('id') then it will show 'title' because the id is the title

set attribute, it wil change what the other component is having like title will be changed to something else

also there are different text like inner text, text content and all the differnt text have there own work like innertext will only show what are the contents are there in the html page then text content shows the content whcih is there in the code 

inner html also supports the whole html code and the syntax so that we can make the changes through the cosole only -->
<!-- query selector of differnt types are there like query selector and query selector all, and it selects and shows the query, and also the css syntax are also working with it so people generally refer it  -->
