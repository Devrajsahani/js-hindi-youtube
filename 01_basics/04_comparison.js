// so basically here when we compare all the logical operations we will get the answers in boolean form like true or false 
// and most of the time we know the answer of the solution 
console.log(null==0); // so here again js is converted the null as 0 and 0 ==0 it is givign the ouput as false and it can also be converted to NaN
// === triple check is the strict check and check the crucial condition before taking any decision and also the conversion of the logical oprators can put us in a lot of confusion.
