## 4 pillars of OOP 
- Abstraction - Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of something.
- Encapsulation - Bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (like an object or a class), and restricting access to some of the internal details.

- Inheritance - One object (or class) can inherit the properties and methods of another object (or class).
